Aggregate Queries

A function  where multiple rows are grouped together to form one value, basically running multiple queries with one query.


COUNT-

Returns the amount of records that match the criteria

SELECT COUNT(<column_name>) FROM <table_name> WHERE <condition>


SUM- 

Returns the  calculated total from a numerical field

SELECT SUM(<column_to_sum>) FROM <table> WHERE <conditions>;



MIN/MAX/AVG-

SELECT MIN(<column_to_be_checked>) FROM <table> WHERE <conditions>;

SELECT MAX(<column_to_be_checked>) FROM <table> WHERE <conditions>;

SELECT AVG(<column_to_be_checked>) FROM <table> WHERE <conditions>;


GROUP BY-

Used in conjunction (primarily with the above Agg. Funcs.) to bring together sections of data

SELECT <column_name>, MAX(<column_name_to_find_max_in) AS <max_column_name> FROM <table> GROUP BY <column_name>;
