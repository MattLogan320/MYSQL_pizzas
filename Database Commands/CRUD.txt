Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a subset of SQL used to manipulate the contents of a database
Data Definitin Language (DDL) is the subset used to gnereate and control our databases (schema)

There are four main DML operators  (MYSQL KEYWORDS):

Create      (INSERT INTO)
Read        (SELECT)
Update      (UPDATE)
Delete      (DELETE)

Create:

INSERT INTO <table_name> (column_name1, column_name2,column_name3 etc.)
VALUES (value1,value2,value3 etc.),
(second_value1,second_value2,second_value3 etc.)
;


Read:

SELECT * FROM <table_name> ---> will show all values in table 
SELECT <all_desired_fields> FROM <table_name>
SELECT <desired_columns> FROM <table_name> WHERE <constarint>=<value>


Update:

This finds an existing record and replaces one of the values of the record with new information (e.g. changing password)

UPDATE <table_name>
SET <column_name>='<value_in_field_to_change>
WHERE <column_name>=<value_to_be_changed> ;


Delete:

DELETE FROM <table_name>; --> Deletes all entries from table
DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <field> = <value> ;
DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <field> operator(><= etc.) <value> ;
